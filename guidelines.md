## Checklist for open sourcing code

These questions are less high-level, and can be used to do a final review before open sourcing code:

- Has it been licensed?
- Does it conform to the departmental style-guide?
- Have the dependencies been licensed adequately?
- Does it have a permanent DOI?
- Are any articles attached to it referenced or included with the code?
